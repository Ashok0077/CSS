INLINE STYLES:-
You can write your styles directly inline on each element, but this is NOT A GOOD IDEA most of the time.

THE <STYLE> ELEMENT:-
You can write your styles inside of a <style> element. This is easy, but it makes it impossible to share styles between documents.
Not recommended either.

EXTERNAL STYLESHEET:-
Write your styles in a .css file, and them include the using a <link> in the head of your html document.
